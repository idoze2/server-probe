Hi,

You need to create an application that tests and records the response times of a list of common websites (“google.com”, “facebook.com”, “twitter.com”,  “cnet.com”, “amazon.com”).

The backend should execute the HTTP requests to the websites, saving the results to a DB/File/Memory and exposing the results in a REST API endpoint. The data needs to be updated and reflected in the graph periodically.

The frontend should show a linear graph with the response times overtime for each of the websites, with start tests and stop tests buttons.

The data should be saved and available when closing the browser and reopening the app (thus avoiding an empty graph).

 

Any selection of backend technology or framework is OK.

The frontend should be implemented as a Single Page ReactJS Application.

Usage of any external library is allowed.

 

The program should be submitted by a ZIP file containing all needed files for execution, and instructions on how to run them.

If any questions arise, let us know.

Good luck!
